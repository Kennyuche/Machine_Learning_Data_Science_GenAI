# SentimentScope: Sentiment Analysis using Transformers

## 📌 Project Overview
**SentimentScope** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that applies **Transformer-based models** to perform **sentiment analysis on text data**. The goal of this project is to build, fine-tune, and evaluate a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying sentiment from real-world text inputs.

This project demonstrates:
- Text preprocessing for NLP
- Dataset exploration and preparation
- Transformer-based model training
- Model evaluation and performance analysis


## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is too large to be hosted directly on GitHub.
