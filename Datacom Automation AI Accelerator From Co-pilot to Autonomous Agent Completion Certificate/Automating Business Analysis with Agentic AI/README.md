# Automating Business Analysis with Agentic AI
A streamlined approach to improving order-processing efficiency through AI-driven automation.

## 📌 Overview
This project documents the transformation of a manual order-processing workflow into an agentic AI–powered automated system. It includes analysis of the existing process, design of the proposed solution, risk considerations, and the projected business impact.

The repository is meant to support business analysts, AI engineers, and operations teams exploring how autonomous agents can be integrated into real-world business workflows.
